I'm a passionate Computer Science undergraduate at the **National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra**, graduating in 2026. I have a strong interest in compilers, chaos theory, dynamical systems, and high-performance computing.

-    I‚Äôm currently working on enhancing my parser combinator library, **[Pcom-Go](https://github.com/BlackBuck/pcom-go)** and building a novel algorithm for chaos-based encryption.
-    I‚Äôm currently learning **Rust**  and exploring its applications in systems programming.
-    I‚Äôm open to collaborating on open-source compiler tools, performance-critical libraries, and full-stack web applications.
-    How to reach me: **anilkumarpanwar2929@gmail.com**  or on **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/uneel)**.
-    Fun fact: I believe that if it's not fun, you're not doing it right.

### üöÄ Some of My Projects

<details>
<summary><b>Pcom-Go - High-Performance Parser Combinator Library in Go</b></summary>

- **Description**: An engineered high-performance parser combinator library in Go that has received 10+ GitHub stars.
- **Key Features**:
    - Architected a checkpoint/rollback system to boost developer productivity in complex parsing scenarios.
    - Improved performance by **3x** in nested parsers by reducing memory allocations and avoiding redundant copies.
    - Enhanced the developer experience with color-coded error messages and full backtracking support.
- **Tech**: `Go`
- **[Source Code](https://github.com/BlackBuck/pcom-go)**
